          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Sebin Lee, a passionate Probability and Statistics major at UC San Diego with a strong foundation in mathematics, data analysis, and programming. I thrive in analytical environments where I can bring meaningful insights to complex challenges.
          </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in math analysis, statistics, and probability theory as part of my degree program.

          As a member of the Like Lion programming club at UC San Diego, I completed a 10-week web development course, where I developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, and GitHub. This experience, combined with my leadership in high school when I founded a coding club and developed a simulation game showcased at our school festival, has reinforced my programming foundation and collaborative abilities.

          My professional journey began with hands-on experience in a South Korean pharmacy, where I assisted customers, supported pharmacists, and ensured the workspace was organized. Additionally, I volunteered at Hanbit Church in San Diego, helping with event support, welcoming newcomers, and coordinating church activities, which taught me the importance of communication, organization, and community.
